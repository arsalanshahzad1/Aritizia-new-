            <p>
                Subject to applicable laws and regulations, we may from time to time send direct marketing materials promoting services, products, facilities, or activities to you using information collected from or about you.

It is our policy to not provide your Personal Information for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes without your consent.
            </p><br />

            <h2>VI. Information Security</h2><br />
            <p>
                No security is foolproof, and the Internet is an insecure medium. We cannot guarantee absolute security, but we work hard to protect Artizia and you from unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure, or destruction of Personal Information we collect and store. Measures we take include encryption of the Artizia website communications with SSL; optional two-factor authentication; periodic review of our Personal Information collection, storage, and processing practices; and restricted access to your Personal Information on a need-to-know basis for our employees, contractors and agents who are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations and may be disciplined or terminated if they fail to meet these obligations.
            </p><br />


            <h2>VII. Information For California Residents</h2><br />
            <p>
                We are required under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) to provide certain information to California residents about how we collect, use and share their personal information, and about the rights and choices California residents may have concerning their personal information. For purposes of this section, “personal information” has the meaning provided in the CCPA.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                <strong>Personal information that we collect, use, and share</strong>
            </p><br />
            <p>
                For ease of reference, we have compiled the chart below to demonstrate how we use the categories of personal information we have collected, used, and disclosed in the past 12 months. We do not “sell” any personal information, as “selling” is defined under the CCPA.

                <strong>California privacy rights</strong>
            </p><br />
            <p>
                California consumers have the following additional rights under the CCPA with respect to their Personal Information. Please understand, however, that these rights are not absolute, and we may decline requests as permitted under applicable law.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                <strong>Right to Request Access.</strong> You may submit a request that Artizia disclose the categories of personal information we have collected about you, the categories of sources from which your personal information is collected, the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information, the categories of third parties with whom we share your personal information, and the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you in the past 12 months.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                <strong>Right to Request Deletion.</strong> You may submit a request that Artizia delete the personal information about you that we have collected from you.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                <strong>Right Not to Receive Discriminatory Treatment.</strong> You have the right to exercise the privacy rights conferred by the CCPA without discriminatory treatment.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                You may submit a request to access or delete your personal information by emailing us at <a href="mailto:info@Artizia.io">info@Artizia.io</a>. We are legally obligated to verify your identity when you submit a request. We may request additional information from you, like your date of birth or a personal identification number, to verify your identity. If we are unable to verify your identity, we may deny your request. If you submit a request to delete your personal information, you will also be required to confirm the deletion request by email.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                You may designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. Your authorized agent must submit proof that you have provided them with power of attorney pursuant to Probate Code sections 4000 to 4465. We may deny a request from a purported authorized agent who does not provide proof of authorization to act on your behalf.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                Please understand that we are not obligated to provide you with access to your personal information more than twice in a 12-month period.
            </p><br />
            <p>
                If your request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, we may either charge a reasonable fee or refuse to act on the request in which case we will notify you of the reason for refusing the request.
            </p><br />
