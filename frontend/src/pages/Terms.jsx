This is true unless we expressly state otherwise in writing. The Artizia logo and any other names, logos, or slogans for our products or services that may appear on the Site or in other places are trademarks of Artizia or our affiliates and may not be copied, imitated, or used, in whole or in part, without our prior written consent. Without our express written consent, you may not use any Artizia Content to link to the Site. Without our express written consent, you are not permitted to use framing techniques to enclose any Artizia Content.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                    Additionally, Artizia's service mark, trademark, or trade dress for the Site and Content, including without limitation all page headers, custom graphics, button icons, and scripts, may not be copied, imitated, or used in whole or in part without our prior written consent.
                </p><br />

                <p>
                    Despite anything to the contrary herein, you acknowledge and agree that you shall not own or otherwise have any property interest in your account, and you further acknowledge and agree that Artizia shall own and retain all rights in and to your account forever.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>12.1) Terms of Sale</h4><br />
                <p>
                    When you place a bid or order on Artizia, you are acknowledging that you are making a binding offer to purchase the NFTs or Service. Your order is considered accepted and confirmed once the purchase is complete and Artizia displays the Confirmation Page Page ("Confirmation Page"). It is important to note that the supply of NFTs begins immediately after the Confirmation Page is displayed.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                    Refunds or returns are not permitted, except in cases where statutory warranties or guarantees that cannot be excluded or limited by law apply.
                </p><br />

                <p>
                    Creators or Publishers may choose to offer certain rights to holders of their NFTs, such as physical items, special access, or exclusive content (referred to as "Additional Items"). Please be aware that any Additional Items will be provided directly to you by the Creator or Publisher. Artizia does not participate in these transactions and is not a party to them. However, Artizia may allow the Creator or Publisher to describe the Additional Items on the Site. If you own an NFT that entitles you to Additional Items, you consent to Artizia sharing your contact information with the Creator or Publisher to facilitate the delivery of those Additional Items. It is important to note that unless otherwise stated, transactions on the Secondary Market only involve the NFTs themselves and do not grant the purchaser any rights to Additional Items.
                </p><br />

                <p>
                    As the seller's agent, Artizia will receive payments on behalf of the seller of an NFT. If you are a seller of an NFT, you appoint Artizia as your agent for the purpose of receiving, holding, and settling payments made by buyers of the NFTs you sell.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                    When a buyer makes a payment to us on behalf of the seller, it fulfills the buyer's obligation to the seller for the amount of the payment received, regardless of whether we actually settle the payment to the seller. If we fail to make such a payment to a seller as described in these Terms of Use, the seller's recourse is against us and not against the buyer. The payment is considered to be made by the buyer to the seller upon receipt by us. Please note that to the extent permitted by the rules of any third-party or governmental body with jurisdiction over us, we are not liable for the seller's actions or omissions, and we disclaim any such liability.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h4>12.2) Billing and Cancellation</h4><br />

                <p>
                    <strong>Billing Cycle.</strong> The membership fee for the Artizia service and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged to your Payment Method on the specific payment date indicated on the "Account" page. The length of your billing cycle will depend on the type of subscription that you choose when you signed up for the service. Membership fees are fully earned upon payment. In some cases your payment date may change, for example if your Payment Method has not successfully settled, when you change your subscription plan or if your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. We may authorize your Payment Method in anticipation of membership or service-related charges through various methods, including authorizing it up to approximately one month of service as soon as you register. If you signed up for Artizia using your account with a third party as a Payment Method, you can find the billing information about your Artizia membership by visiting your account with the applicable third party.
                </p><br />

                <p>
                    <strong>Payment Methods.</strong> To use the Artizia service you must provide one or more Payment Methods. You authorize us to charge any Payment Method associated with your account in case your primary Payment Method is declined or no longer available to us for payment of your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and you do not cancel your account, we may suspend your access to the service until we have successfully charged a valid Payment Method. For some Payment Methods, the issuer may charge you certain fees, such as foreign transaction fees or other fees relating to the processing of your Payment Method. Check with your Payment Method service provider for details.
                </p><br />

                <p>
                    <strong>Updating your Payment Methods.</strong> You can update your Payment Methods by going to the "Account" page. We may also update your Payment Methods using information provided by the payment service providers. Following any update, you authorize us to continue to charge the applicable Payment Method(s).
                </p><br />

                <p>
                    <strong>Cancellation.</strong> You can cancel your Artizia membership at any time, and you will continue to have access to the Artizia service through the end of your billing period. To cancel, go to the "Account" page on our Artizia.com website and follow the instructions for cancellation. If you cancel your membership, your account will automatically close at the end of your current billing period.
                </p><br />

                <p>
                    <strong>Changes to the Price and Subscription Plans. </strong>We may change our subscription plans and the price of our service from time to time; however, any price changes or changes to your subscription plans will apply no earlier than 30 days following notice to you. If you do not wish to accept the price change or change to your subscription plan, you can cancel your subscription before the change takes effect.
                </p><br />
                <p>
                    <strong>No Refunds. </strong>Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used membership periods. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current billing period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our members ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.
                </p>

                <br />

                    <li>The value of NFTs may be derived from the continued willingness of market participants to exchange fiat currency or digital assets for NFTs, which may result in the potential for permanent and total loss of value of a particular NFTs should the market for that NFTs disappear;</li>

                <br />
                <h2>20) External Projects</h2><br />
                <p>Except for those NFTs sold by the Artizia Curated Publisher, Artizia allows for the display, purchase, and sale of NFTs that were listed directly by a Publisher (“Publisher Projects”) or that were not initially sold through Artizia (“External Projects”). Artizia has the right, in its sole discretion, to determine the criteria that Publisher Projects and External Projects must meet before being allowed onto the Artizia Platform and to remove any Publisher Projects or External Projects that do not comply with these Terms of Use or other requirements of Artizia.</p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>Creators of External Projects:</strong> If you are a Creator of an External Project, you will be entitled to the same share of sales of your NFTs on Artizia as you would be on the platform that you initially released the NFTs on; provided, however, that: (i) you and your NFTs Creations from External Projects comply with these Terms of Use; and (ii) you provide Artizia with all information that it requests from you. By selling your NFTs Creations from an External Project on Artizia, you represent and warrant that you have all necessary licenses and permits to the artwork contained in your NFTs. As a Creator of an External Project, you grant Artizia all licenses granted by Creators under these Terms of Use. Your proceeds will be delivered into your Artizia account.</p>
                <br />
                <p><strong>Owners of NFTs from External Projects:</strong> If you acquired an NFTs from an External Project outside Artizia, by transferring such NFTs to your Artizia account, you represent and warrant that you have all right and title to such NFTs and that you have the right to display and/or sell such NFTs on Artizia.</p>

                <p><strong>Buyers of Publisher Projects and External Projects:</strong> You understand and agree that your purchase of an NFTs from a Publisher Project or an External Project is made from the seller of such NFTs and not Artizia. Artizia makes no representations or warranties with respect to NFTs from Publisher Projects or External Projects and all such purchases are made on an “as is” basis.</p>
               
                <br />
                <h2>21) External Listings</h2><br />
                <p>Artizia may display NFTs, including prices, made available by or obtained from platforms other than Artizia (“External Listings”).

By purchasing an External Listing, you acknowledge and agree that Artizia is in no way responsible for the accuracy, timeliness, or completeness of such External Listings.</p>
                <br />
                <p>If you choose to purchase an NFTs from an External Listing, Artizia will act as a facilitator in the acquisition of such NFTs and transfer it to you. Artizia will cease acting as facilitator as soon as such NFTs is transferred to you.</p>
                <br />
                <p>To facilitate the acquisition of your External Listing, Artizia will charge your method of payment, in addition to the price of the External Listing, any applicable charges for taxes and fees (an amount that will be disclosed to you before you elect to proceed).

                <p>If Artizia is unable to acquire an NFTs from an External Listing for any reason whatsoever, Artizia will cancel the transaction and your funds will be returned to you.

                <br />

                <h2>23) Limitation of Liability</h2><br />
                <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL ARTIZIA BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFIT OR ANY INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, THE SITE, PRODUCTS OR THIRD PARTY SITES AND PRODUCTS, OR FOR ANY DAMAGES RELATED TO LOSS OF REVENUE, LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF USE, LOSS OF GOODWILL, OR LOSS OF DATA, AND WHETHER CAUSED BY TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), BREACH OF CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF FORESEEABLE AND EVEN IF ARTIZIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.

                <br />
                <h2>24) Indemnification</h2><br />
                <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Artizia, and our respective past, present, and future employees, officers, directors, contractors, consultants, equity holders, suppliers, vendors, service providers, parent companies, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, representatives, predecessors, successors, and assigns (individually and collectively, the “Artizia Parties”), from and against all actual or alleged third party claims, damages, awards, judgments, losses, liabilities, obligations, penalties, interest, fees, expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys’ fees and expenses) and costs (including, without limitation, court costs, costs of settlement and costs of pursuing indemnification and insurance), of every kind and nature whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, matured or unmatured, or suspected or unsuspected, in law or equity, whether in tort, contract, or otherwise (collectively, “Claims”), including, but not limited to, damages to property or personal injury, that are caused by, arise out of or are related to (a) any intellectual property disputes relating to your Profile Information, Creator Content (if you are a Creator), or your Publisher Content (if you are a Publisher); (b) your use or misuse of the Services, the Site, or NFTs, (c) any Feedback you provide, (d) your violation of these Terms of Use, (e) your violation of the rights of a third party, including another user or MetaMask, and (f) your failure to pay any Withholding Taxes or Sales Taxes in connection with your NFTs transactions or to provide us with a properly executed tax form described in Section 13.

                <br />
                <h2>25) Governing Law</h2><br />
                <p>These Terms of Use, your use of Artizia, your rights and obligations, and all actions contemplated by, arising out of or related to these Terms of Use shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, as if these Terms of Use are a contract wholly entered into and wholly performed within the State of California. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT YOUR USE OF ARTIZIA AS CONTEMPLATED BY THESE TERMS OF USE SHALL BE DEEMED TO HAVE OCCURRED IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND BE SUBJECT TO THE INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT REGARD TO ITS CONFLICTS OF LAWS PROVISIONS.</p>

                <br />
                <h2>26) Dispute Resolution</h2><br />
                <p>Please read the following agreement to arbitrate (“Arbitration Agreement”) in its entirety. This Arbitration Agreement requires you and Artizia to arbitrate disputes with one another and limits the manner in which either party can seek relief from the other.</p>
                <br />
                <p>You and Artizia agree and understand that any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or your relationship with Artizia—past, present, or future—shall be settled solely and exclusively by binding arbitration held in the county in which you reside, or another mutually agreeable location, including remotely by way of video conference administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (“NAM”) and conducted in English, rather than in court. You and Artizia expressly agree that any dispute about the scope of these Terms of Use to arbitrate and/or the arbitrability of any particular dispute shall be resolved in arbitration in accordance with this section. You and Artizia expressly agree that an arbitrator may issue all appropriate declaratory and injunctive relief necessary to ensure the arbitration of disputes (but only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim). You and Artizia agree to keep any arbitration strictly confidential.</p>
                <br />
                <p>You and Artizia agree that this arbitration provision applies not just to disputes between you and Artizia but also to (a) disputes with Artizia and any other party named or added as a co-defendant along with Artizia at any time, and (b) disputes in which a party is named as a defendant involving claim(s) arising from or related to these Terms of Use or any other Artizia agreement or program terms, even if Artizia is not named or added as a defendant. Any such co-defendant or defendant is a third-party beneficiary entitled to enforce this arbitration provision.</p>
                <br />
                <p>You and Artizia agree that the arbitrator shall have the authority to order any remedies, legal or equitable, which a party could obtain from a court of competent jurisdiction in an individual case based on the claims asserted, and nothing more. The arbitrator shall not award punitive or exemplary damages to either party, unless such remedies would otherwise be available under applicable law.</p>
                <br />
                <p>You and Artizia acknowledge that this arbitration provision evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. s. 1 et seq. (“FAA”), will govern its interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties to be bound by the provisions of the FAA for all purposes, including, but not limited to, interpretation, implementation, enforcement, and administration of this arbitration provision, and the FAA shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by the law.</p>
                <br />
                <p>You and Artizia agree that good-faith, informal efforts to resolve disputes often can result in a prompt, low-cost, and mutually beneficial outcome. Therefore, a party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a written Notice of Dispute (“Dispute Notice”). Any Dispute Notice to Artizia must be sent to info@Artizia.io (“Notice Address”). Any Dispute Notice to you by Artizia will be sent to the email address registered with your Artizia Account. Any Dispute Notice must include: (a) the name, address, and email address of the party providing the Dispute Notice; (b) a description of the nature and basis of the claim or dispute, including any relevant facts regarding Artizia or your use of Artizia; (c) an explanation of the specific relief sought, including the total damages sought, if any, and the basis for the damage calculations; (d) a signed statement from the party providing the Dispute Notice verifying the accuracy of the contents of the Dispute Notice; and (e) if the dispute is from you, and you have retained an attorney, a signed statement from you authorizing Artizia to disclose your account details to your attorney if necessary in resolving your claim or dispute. Any Dispute Notice from you must be individualized, meaning it can only concern your dispute and no other person’s dispute. And any Dispute Notice from Artizia must be individualized, meaning it can only concern you and no other person. You also agree that, after sending a Demand Notice to Artizia, at Artizia’s request you will personally participate in a discussion by telephone with Artizia to discuss whether an agreement can be reached to resolve the claim before arbitration is initiated. If you are represented by counsel, you agree that you will personally attend the telephone conference with your counsel. Artizia also agrees to participate in such a telephone discussion at your request. Any informal dispute resolution conferences shall be individualized, such that a separate conference must be held each time either party intends to commence individual arbitration; multiple individuals initiating claims cannot participate in the same informal telephonic dispute resolution conference, unless mutually agreed to by the parties. You agree that compliance with these informal dispute resolution procedures is a condition precedent to commencing arbitration, and that the arbitrator shall dismiss any arbitration filed without fully and completely complying with these informal dispute resolution procedures.</p>
                <p>If you and Artizia do not reach an agreement to resolve a claim within 60 days after a Demand Notice is received, you or Artizia may commence an arbitration proceeding; except that, if either you or Artizia send the other an incomplete Dispute Notice, the 60-day period begins only after a complete Dispute Notice is received, and if either you or Artizia request a telephone discussion, the 60-day period begins only after the discussion has occurred. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while the parties engage in these informal dispute resolution procedures.</p>
                
                <br />
                <h2>Arbitration and Dispute Resolution</h2><br />
                <p>Should any dispute proceed to arbitration, you and Artizia agree that any such arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with the prevailing NAM rules and procedures (including the Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules and Procedures and/or the Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration Filings, as applicable) (“NAM Rules”), with the following exceptions to the NAM Rules if in conflict:</p>
                <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>The arbitration shall be conducted by one neutral arbitrator;</li>
                    <li>Each side agrees to bear its own attorney’s fees, costs, and expenses, unless such remedies would otherwise be available under applicable law, or unless the arbitrator finds that a claim, counterclaim, or defense is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)); and</li>
                    <li>All pleadings submitted in arbitration are subject to the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, which, among other things, permits sanctions to be imposed where pleadings are submitted for an improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of litigation.</li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <p>The arbitrator may issue orders (including subpoenas to third parties, to the extent permitted by law) allowing the parties to conduct discovery sufficient to allow each party to prepare that party's claims and/or defenses, taking into consideration that arbitration is designed to be a speedy and efficient method for resolving disputes. For example, the arbitrator shall apply the Apex Doctrine and preclude depositions of either party’s current or former high-level officers absent a showing that the officer has unique, personal knowledge of discoverable information and less burdensome discovery methods have been exhausted.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Additionally, if, at any time, 25 or more similar demands for arbitration are asserted against either party or their related parties by the same or coordinated counsel or entities (“Mass Filing”), the additional protocols set forth below shall apply:</p>
                <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>NAM’s Mass Filing Rules shall apply if the parties’ dispute is deemed by NAM, in its sole discretion pursuant to the NAM Rules and this Dispute Resolution section, to be part of a Mass Filing.</li>
                    <li>Any Mass Filing shall be subject to a bellwether proceeding intended to reach a fair and speedy resolution of all claims included in the Mass Filing. In any Mass Filing, NAM shall select 15 demands for arbitration to proceed (“Bellwether Arbitrations”). While the Bellwether Arbitrations are adjudicated, no other demand for arbitration that is part of the Mass Filings may be filed, processed, or adjudicated, and no filing fees for such a demand for arbitration shall be due from either party to the administrator. Any applicable statute of limitations regarding such a demand for arbitration shall remain tolled beginning when the Mass Filing claimant first provided the other party with its Dispute Notice, as defined above.</li>
                    <li>Following the resolution of the Bellwether Arbitrations, the parties shall engage in a global mediation of all remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing. The mediation shall be administered by NAM. If the parties are unable to resolve the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing within 30 days following the mediation, the remaining demands for arbitration comprising the Mass Filing shall be administered by NAM on an individual basis pursuant to the NAM Rules.</li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <p>You and Artizia agree to abide by all decisions and awards rendered in such proceedings and you and Artizia agree that such decisions and awards rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and conclusive, except for any appeal rights under the FAA.</p>
                <br />
                <p>To the extent you or Artizia seek emergency relief in connection with any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use or the breach thereof, or your relationship with Artizia, you and Artizia agree that these Terms of Use restrict you or Artizia from seeking emergency relief from any court (except as provided below), including without limitation temporary restraining orders and/or preliminary injunctions, and you and Artizia agree that, to the extent either party breaches these Terms of Use by seeking such relief from a court, that party shall be responsible for paying the opposing party’s attorneys’ fees in opposing such relief, and the arbitrator shall render an award of such attorneys’ fees at the earliest possible time after such fees are incurred.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to settle disputes through arbitration, you or Artizia may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims (or an equivalent) court in Orange County, California or any United States county where you live. However, if the claims are transferred, removed, or appealed to a different court, they shall be subject to arbitration.</p>
                <br />
                <p>You and Artizia agree that you or Artizia may, without inconsistency with this arbitration provision, apply to any court for an order enforcing the arbitral award. You and Artizia irrevocably and unconditionally agree to waive any objection that you or Artizia may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding relating to enforcement of the arbitral award in the federal or state courts located in the State of California.</p>
                <br />
                <p>You and Artizia agree that all such controversies, claims, or disputes shall be settled in this manner in lieu of any action at law or equity. In arbitration, the parties waive their rights to have a jury trial.</p>
                <br />
                <p>IF FOR ANY REASON THIS ARBITRATION CLAUSE BECOMES NOT APPLICABLE OR FOR ANY OTHER REASON LITIGATION PROCEEDS IN COURT THEN THE PARTIES AGREE THAT YOU AND ARTIZIA:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AS TO ANY ISSUE RELATING HERETO IN ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING, OR COUNTERCLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS OF USE OR THE SERVICES THAT ARTIZIA PROVIDES OR ANY OTHER MATTER INVOLVING US HERETO, AND</li>
                    <li>SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION AND VENUE OF THE FEDERAL OR STATE COURTS LOCATED IN ORANGE COUNTY, CALIFORNIA AND YOU AGREE NOT TO INSTITUTE ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN ANY OTHER COURT IN ANY OTHER JURISDICTION.</li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <p>You and Artizia agree to arbitrate solely on an individual basis, and agree and understand that these Terms of Use do not permit class action or private attorney general litigation or arbitration of any claims brought as a plaintiff or class member in any class or representative arbitration proceeding or litigation (“Representative and Class Action Waiver”). The arbitral or other tribunal may not consolidate more than one party’s claims and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prohibit settlements on a class-wide or representative basis.</p>
                
                <br />
                <h2>Termination</h2><br />
                <p>We reserve the right, without notice and in our sole discretion, to terminate your license to access or use Artizia, the Services, or the Site, at any time and for any reason. You understand and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation to you in such an event.</p>

                <br />
                <h2>Severability</h2><br />
                <p>If any term, clause, or provision of these Terms of Use is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause, or provision shall be severable from these Terms of Use and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining part of that term, clause, or provision, or any other terms, clause, or provision of these Terms of Use.</p>


                <br />
                <h2>Entire Agreement</h2><br />
                <p>These Terms of Use comprise the entire agreement between you and Artizia relating to your access to and use of Artizia, the Services, and the Site, and supersede any and all prior discussions, agreements, and understandings of any kind (including without limitation prior versions of these Terms of Use). Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms of Use are intended solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any other person or entity.</p>

                <br />
                <h2>Survival</h2><br />
                <p>You agree and understand that all provisions of these Terms of Use shall survive the termination or expiration of these Terms of Use.</p>
